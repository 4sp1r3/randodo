# Randodo - random strings generator

## What is Randodo?

My goal is to create a simple & fast **random strings generator**, which should be available both as a **command-line utility** and a **C++ library**. Users should be able to control how the generated strings might look like by writing simple specifications, similar to typical **regular expressions**.

Randodo definitely **isn't finished yet**.

## Use cases 

Randodo has been started as a tool useful for testing other stuff, so I would guess that **testing** will be the main use of Randodo. But I wouldn't mind being surprised!

## Examples

```
Sorry, not yet!
