Users should be able to control how the generated strings might look like by writing simple specifications, similar to typical **regular expressions**.\r\n\r\nRandodo definitely **isn't finished yet**.\r\n\r\n## Use cases \r\n\r\nRandodo has been started as a tool useful for testing other stuff, so I would guess that **testing** will be the main use of Randodo. But I wouldn't mind being surprised!\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\n```\r\nSorry, not yet!\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
